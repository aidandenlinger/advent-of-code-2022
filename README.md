# aidandenlinger's Advent of Code 2022

Doing Advent of Code 2022 in Rust for fun :)

Solutions will likely be non-optimal, they will try to be idiomatic to the
extent of my knowledge of Rust. You can find Advent of Code 2022 [here](https://
adventofcode.com/2022).

## Install
You need the rust toolchain, which you can install with [rustup](https://
rustup.rs/).

## Usage
Each day has two folders - one for part a and one for part b.

To run, open that day and part's folder, place your desired input in `input.txt`
(by default my input is there), and run `cargo run`. These solutions assume
proper input, it will panic on improper inputs.

`cargo test` will run basic tests on the examples from the problem prompt.

## Thanks
Thanks to other folks publishing their Rust repos to refine my code afterwards :)
